[miss T] Well, well ... new wanderer around here, huh!?            
         Or, should I rather say ... "wonderer"?                   
         
[miss T] Now, brave explorer, tell me.                             
         Whould you be so kind to come back here in a              
         while? I have a splitting headache and, although          
         I would be pleased to, I can't help you right now.        

[miss T] Please come back later, and I promise I will              
         show you the way through these odd backrooms.

                                                  Sounds good [you]

[rabbit(?)] Well, good. Certainty is a fallacy anyway...           

[rabbit(?)] I am afraid, though, time is my enemy.                 
            Let me ask my friend, Miss Turtle, to guide            
            you through the paths of this dark, odd land.          

[rabbit(?)] You can call her "Miss T"                             

                                                     Not sure [you]

[rabbit(?)] Are you  L O S T  ?
