[you] It would be cool to see something more "personal"            

[miss T] Well, these are some more personal "selfies", as you      
         people now call them...

<pre><i>Morgan and I, some vet practice in Modica.</i></pre>
<br/>

<pre><i>Self-portrait on my first COVID-19 Vaccine, London.</i></pre>
<br/>

[miss T] Oh. The next one is not really a selfie ...  and it       
         is not really by Fabrizio himself. Quite a peculiar one,  
         huh!?

[miss T] Would you like to see more? It seems like Fabrizio has fun  
         taking portraits in reflections...
