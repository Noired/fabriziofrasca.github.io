  title: "Understanding and Extending Subgraph GNNs by Rethinking their Symmetries"
  venue: Learning on Graphs and Geometry Reading Group
  link: https://twitter.com/HannesStaerk/status/1592174079892594688
  tldr: "Many concurrent works seem to share a similar underlying intuition: to represent a graph by processing subgraphs generated via some simple selection policy. Inspired by a novel symmetry analyses for the most prominent of these methods – those where subgraphs are in a 1:1 correspondence with nodes in the original graph – we prove an upper-bound on their expressive power and conceive a framework serving as a design space for future new equivariant node-based subgraph architectures."

  venue: "Simone Scardapane's Group Talks (Sapienza)"
  link: https://www.sscardapane.it/seminars/subgraph-gnn
  tldr: "We line up our latest two works on subgraphs for more expressive GNNs to tell a coherent story. In the first part of the talk we show the design of a novel framework (ESAN) to process generic bags of subgraphs in an equivariant manner. We show that this approach effectively increases the expressive power of MPNNs. Then, we notice a surge in concurrent approaches which – sometimes unwittingly – make use of subgraphs for powerful graph representations. In the second part, a novel symmetry analysis allows to unify and better characterise these approaches when using a node-based selection policy. Ee prove an upper-bound on their expressive power and conceive a framework serving as a design space for equivariant node-based subgraph methods."

  tldr: "We explore the idea of modeling a graph as a bag of subgraphs generated by simple, domain agnostic selection policies, such as node-deletion, edge-deletion, ego-networks. We formally show that this approach lead to the design Graph Neural Networks which can be made strictly more powerful than standard Message Passing ones. We prove this by defining a novel WL variant and by constructing layers equivariant to the emerging symmetry group."

Giorgos Bouritsas and I lead and moderate this interactive discussion on approaches to go beyond 1-WL discriminating power. Ultimately, we would like to tackle the following question: 'Is the Weisfeiler-Leman hierarchy suitable to study the representational power of learning models on graphs? Do we necessarily need to go beyond message-passing?'"
