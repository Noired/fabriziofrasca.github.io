Hey! I am Fabrizio. I am a Machine Learning Researcher at Twitter Cortex and a PhD candidate at Imperial College London, advised by Prof. Michael Bronstein.

I broadly work on _Deep Learning for graph-structured data_, arguably the most popular form of [Geometric Deep Learning](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/).

My current research focusses on overcoming the intrinsic representational limits of Graph Neural Network. I have explored extensions of message-passing schemes that can capture non-trivial meso-scale topological patterns in networks, and equivariance to symmetries as an overarching design principle to design provably expressive architectures.

In the past, I have conducted more applied research revolving around the application of Machine Learning approaches to problems in the realm of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, in particular: drug repurposing and epigenetic gene expression regulation.

Going forward, I would be keen to approach back bio applications of my latest more theoretical research!
